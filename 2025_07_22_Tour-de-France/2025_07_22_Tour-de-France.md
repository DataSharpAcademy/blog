## 1. Tour de France Records: Data Challenges and Cycling Trivia Facts

Our Tour de France blog series returns for a second episode in which we
will learn how to manipulate strings to uncover Tour de France trivia
facts.

In [our last
post](https://datasharpacademy.com/tour-de-france-meets-data-science-a-beginners-case-study/),
we practised loading real-world data, asking simple questions, and
dealing with the inevitable quirks of messy datasets.

Today, we‚Äôre gaining more confidence and moving forward.

We will use the same **Tour de France dataset** to tackle *more complex,
layered questions*. These will require you to think critically, combine
columns, process text, and validate your assumptions carefully.

This post will show you how to:

-   **Transform messy columns** into clean, usable numbers.
-   **Extract structured information** from unstructured text.
-   **Evaluate results mindfully** to uncover richer and more accurate
    insights.

If you‚Äôre ready to move from ‚Äúbasic data handling‚Äù to ‚Äúpractical
analysis that answers questions,‚Äù this post is for you.

### 1.1 Flashbash: What We Discovered Last Time

In our first exploration of the Tour de France dataset, we uncovered
some surprising insights despite asking seemingly simple questions:

-   üèÜ Only **65 different riders** have won the Tour de France.
-   üö¥ In contrast, **917 different riders or teams** have won at least
    one Tour de France stage.
-   üßê **Three riders** managed to win the Tour de France *without ever
    winning a single stage* in their career.

The process by which we revealed these findings highlighted how even
basic data questions can reveal inconsistencies, typos, and quirks in
real-world datasets, **reminding us that cleaning and validating data is
part of the analysis, not just an annoying pre-step**.

### 1.2 What We‚Äôre Tackling Next

In this post, we‚Äôre levelling up.

We will explore more layered questions, such as:

-   Which city has been visited the most in Tour history?
-   What are the smallest and largest time gaps between the winner and
    the runner-up?
-   Who has finished last the most times?

These questions will stretch our data skills further, as we will:

    ‚ù∂ Practice data cleaning to prepare our data for robust analysis.
    ‚ù∑ Combine information across multiple columns.

Ready? Let‚Äôs dive in.

## 2. Setting The Scene

### 2.1 Installing / Loading Your Packages

As we saw in previous posts, R‚Äôs default base package contains numerous
functionalities. However, it is common to need additional
functionalities that can be loaded with packages. This analysis is no
different. Today, we will use three packages: `readr`, `stringr`, and
`stringi`.

Installing packages in R is straightforward:

    if(!require('readr')) install.packages('readr')
    if(!require('stringr')) install.packages('stringr')
    if(!require('stringi')) install.packages('stringi')

Loading packages is commonly done with the `library(package_name)`
function, specifying the package name. However, it only works if the
package is already installed on your machine. The code above is slightly
longer, but it attempts to load the package using `require()`. If the
package is not found, it will first attempt to install it.

### 2.2 Loading The Data

If you‚Äôve been following along, you‚Äôre already familiar with the
structure of our Tour de France dataset and how to load it into R. If
not, check out [the previous
post](https://datasharpacademy.com/tour-de-france-meets-data-science-a-beginners-case-study/)
for a step-by-step walkthrough.

For this analysis, we will once again load our three tables:

    finishers <- read.csv('./data/tdf_finishers.csv')
    stages <- read.csv('./data/tdf_stages.csv')
    tours <- readr::read_csv('./data/tdf_tours.csv', locale=readr::locale(encoding="UTF-8"))

    ## Rows: 109 Columns: 6
    ## ‚îÄ‚îÄ Column specification ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (3): Dates, Stages, Distance
    ## dbl (3): Year, Starters, Finishers
    ## 
    ## ‚Ñπ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ‚Ñπ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

### 2.3 Cleaning The Data

In the previous post, we identified several inconsistencies in the data,
but we didn‚Äôt address them. We worked around them, using logic and
critical thinking to overcome their challenges. In particular, we found
different name spellings across different tables:

-   `"Maurice De Waele (BEL)"` vs `"Maurice Dewaele (BEL)"`
-   `"Chris Froome (GBR)"` vs `"Chris Froome (UK)"`

To avoid unnecessary complications in our analyses below, I wanted to
fix these issues first. Unfortunately, I immediately encountered a new
problem. See for yourself:

    head(finishers[finishers$Year==2013, ])

    ##      Year Rank                   Rider        Time               Team
    ## 8340 2013    1       Chris Froome¬†(UK) 83h 56' 40"           Team Sky
    ## 8341 2013    2    Nairo Quintana¬†(COL)    + 4' 20"      Movistar Team
    ## 8342 2013    3 Joaquim Rodr√≠guez¬†(ESP)    + 5' 04"       Team Katusha
    ## 8343 2013    4  Alberto Contador¬†(ESP)    + 6' 27"       Saxo‚ÄìTinkoff
    ## 8344 2013    5   Roman Kreuziger¬†(CZE)    + 7' 27"       Saxo‚ÄìTinkoff
    ## 8345 2013    6     Bauke Mollema¬†(NED)   + 11' 42" Belkin Pro Cycling

    finishers[finishers$Rider == "Chris Froome (UK)", ]

    ## [1] Year  Rank  Rider Time  Team 
    ## <0 rows> (or 0-length row.names)

We can see there is at least one entry for ‚ÄúChris Froome (UK)‚Äù in the
`finishers` table. However, when I try to capture it with a boolean
expression, nothing appears. **Why is that now?**

Since I had no idea how to do that in R (I used Python to load the data
and discover the non-ASCII characters), I had to Google it for this
post. Here is the solution I found. It is not perfect, but it does the
job:

    tools::showNonASCII(head(finishers[finishers$Year==2013, 'Rider']))

    ## 1: Chris Froome<c2><a0>(UK)
    ## 2: Nairo Quintana<c2><a0>(COL)
    ## 3: Joaquim Rodr<c3><ad>guez<c2><a0>(ESP)
    ## 4: Alberto Contador<c2><a0>(ESP)
    ## 5: Roman Kreuziger<c2><a0>(CZE)
    ## 6: Bauke Mollema<c2><a0>(NED)

We can now clearly see that the space between the first and last name is
proper, while the ‚Äúspace‚Äù between the name and the country code is
something else! Since the odds of finding more non-ASCII characters
elsewhere in the table are high, the simplest solution for us to move
forward with our analysis is to batch-replace all the non-ASCII
characters with similar ASCII characters (*e.g.* √© by e, √π by u, weird
space by regular space, etc).

Naturally, someone had that problem before and developed a solution for
it. I found it in the `stringi` package, which has a function that
forces all characters to be converted to ASCII. The
`stringi::stri_trans_general()` will thus allow me to encode all my
strings similarly using standard characters.

    finishers$Rider <- stringi::stri_trans_general(finishers$Rider, "latin-ascii")
    stages$Winner <- stringi::stri_trans_general(stages$Winner, "latin-ascii")

We can now verify that the names are looking correct.

    tools::showNonASCII(head(finishers[finishers$Year==2013, 'Rider']))

Empty result, meaning there are no fields with non-ASCII characters
anymore. Everything was changed to ASCII characters. Yay!

We can further validate the changes by re-running our first test. We now
get a match:

    finishers[finishers$Rider == "Chris Froome (UK)", ]

    ##      Year Rank             Rider        Time     Team
    ## 8340 2013    1 Chris Froome (UK) 83h 56' 40" Team Sky

We can now fix the remaining name inconsistencies from the `finishers`
and `stages` tables:

    finishers[finishers$Rider == "Chris Froome (UK)", 'Rider'] <- "Chris Froome (GBR)"
    stages[stages$Winner == 'Maurice Dewaele (BEL)', 'Winner'] <- 'Maurice De Waele (BEL)'

And, as a good practice habit, we always check that the data was
modified as expected.

    finishers[finishers$Rider == "Chris Froome (UK)", ]

    ## [1] Year  Rank  Rider Time  Team 
    ## <0 rows> (or 0-length row.names)

> üìù **Note**: Since I modified the Rider `columns` from `finishers`, I
> also had to modify the `Winner` column from `stages` to ensure that
> the pairings would still be there, even for those without spelling
> issues.

## 3. Now the Fun Begins: Exploring Tour de France Records

### 3.1 Which City Has Been Visited Most Often?

In this question, we aim to find the most visited city in the history of
the Tour de France. Here, ‚Äúvisited‚Äù means either the starting city or
the finishing city of a stage, as recorded in our `stages` table.

This is a fun way to practice string splitting, counting, and sorting in
R while developing your critical thinking skills for evaluating results.

#### Step 1: Look at the Data

Before coding, let‚Äôs check how the information is structured:

    head(stages)

    ##   Year       Date Stage                Course        Distance
    ## 1 1903 1903-07-01     1         Paris to Lyon 467¬†km (290¬†mi)
    ## 2 1903 1903-07-05     2     Lyon to Marseille 374¬†km (232¬†mi)
    ## 3 1903 1903-07-08     3 Marseille to Toulouse 423¬†km (263¬†mi)
    ## 4 1903 1903-07-12     4  Toulouse to Bordeaux 268¬†km (167¬†mi)
    ## 5 1903 1903-07-13     5    Bordeaux to Nantes 425¬†km (264¬†mi)
    ## 6 1903 1903-07-18     6       Nantes to Paris 471¬†km (293¬†mi)
    ##                     Type                      Winner
    ## 1            Plain stage         Maurice Garin (FRA)
    ## 2 Stage with mountain(s) Hippolyte Aucouturier (FRA)
    ## 3            Plain stage Hippolyte Aucouturier (FRA)
    ## 4            Plain stage        Charles Laeser (SUI)
    ## 5            Plain stage         Maurice Garin (FRA)
    ## 6            Plain stage         Maurice Garin (FRA)

You see, the `Course` column contains entries such as ‚ÄúParis to Lyon‚Äù,
‚ÄúLyon to Marseille‚Äù, and so on. We need to cut these strings using the ‚Äù
to ‚Äù keyboard and keep the two outputs.

#### Step 2: Splitting City Names

We need to separate the starting and finishing cities from each Course.
We can use:

-   `stringr::str_split()` to split the strings using ‚Äù to ‚Äù as the
    separator.
-   `simplify = TRUE` to return a matrix with two columns: the start and
    end cities.

<!-- -->

    city_names <- stringr::str_split(stages$Course, ' to ', simplify=TRUE)
    head(city_names)

    ##      [,1]        [,2]       
    ## [1,] "Paris"     "Lyon"     
    ## [2,] "Lyon"      "Marseille"
    ## [3,] "Marseille" "Toulouse" 
    ## [4,] "Toulouse"  "Bordeaux" 
    ## [5,] "Bordeaux"  "Nantes"   
    ## [6,] "Nantes"    "Paris"

**Tip**: Pay attention to the spaces around ‚Äù to ‚Äú. If you forget them,
you‚Äôll get city names like‚ÄùParis ‚Äù or ‚Äù Lyon‚Äù, which will trip you up
later. `"Paris "` (space after) and `" Paris"` (space before) are
different, even for the most intelligent computers.

#### Step 3: Counting and Sorting

Let‚Äôs count how often each city appears as a start or end city:

-   Use `table()` to count each city‚Äôs occurrences across the two
    columns.
-   Use `sort()` to rank the counts in decreasing order.
-   Use `head(..., n=20)` to show the top 20.

<!-- -->

    head(sort(table(city_names), decreasing=TRUE), n=20)

    ## city_names
    ##                Bordeaux         Pau       Paris      Luchon        Metz 
    ##         136         130         127         104          94          76 
    ##    Grenoble        Nice   Perpignan    Brian√ßon   Marseille        Caen 
    ##          75          73          69          67          67          65 
    ##     Bayonne Montpellier       Brest      Nantes    Toulouse     Belfort 
    ##          61          58          56          53          52          51 
    ##     Roubaix         Gap 
    ##          49          48

#### Step 4: Checking Results Critically

The most visited city (136 visits) is ‚Ä¶ a city without a name! üòµ‚Äçüí´

While we might first think there is another issue with the data, let‚Äôs
shift our mindset and look at this as if it were *the correct answer*.

Let‚Äôs look for patterns in our data:

    sum(city_names[, 1] == '') ## Counting how many start cities don't have a name

    ## [1] 0

    sum(city_names[, 2] == '') ## Counting how many arrival cities don't have a name

    ## [1] 136

It turns out that all the blank names are arrival cities. Let‚Äôs examine
them further:

    head(stages[city_names[, 2] == '', ])

    ##     Year       Date Stage                       Course        Distance
    ## 782 1955 1955-07-07    1b                       Dieppe  12.5¬†km (8¬†mi)
    ## 807 1956 1956-07-08    4a Circuit de Rouen-Les-Essarts  15.1¬†km (9¬†mi)
    ## 829 1957 1957-06-29    3a  Circuit de la Prairie, Caen  15¬†km (9.3¬†mi)
    ## 843 1957 1957-07-12   15b     Montju√Øc circuit (Spain) 9.8¬†km (6.1¬†mi)
    ## 858 1958 1958-07-03     8                   Ch√¢teaulin   46¬†km (29¬†mi)
    ## 889 1959 1959-07-10    15                  Puy de D√¥me  12¬†km (7.5¬†mi)
    ##                      Type                    Winner
    ## 782       Team time trial               Netherlands
    ## 807 Individual time trial         Charly Gaul (LUX)
    ## 829       Team time trial                    France
    ## 843 Individual time trial    Jacques Anquetil (FRA)
    ## 858 Individual time trial         Charly Gaul (LUX)
    ## 889   Mountain time trial Federico Bahamontes (ESP)

If we examine the `Course` column, we can see that only one city name is
specified, which supports the results we obtained. Our string splitting
worked as expected.

When we examine the `Type` column, a potential reason emerges. The
‚Äúproblematic‚Äù stages are time trials that often start and end in the
same city. Let‚Äôs verify that:

    table(stages[city_names[, 2] == '', 'Type'])

    ## 
    ##            Flat stage   High mountain stage           Hilly stage 
    ##                     2                     1                     2 
    ## Individual time trial   Mountain time trial           Plain stage 
    ##                    95                     1                    11 
    ##       Team time trial 
    ##                    24

Most of them are time trials, indeed, but not all of them. Regular
stages may also start and end in the same city, such as the
Toulouse-Toulouse stage, which is happening as I write these lines in
the 2025 edition. Such a stage would probably be recorded as `Toulouse`
if our dataset were up to date.

That brings us to a challenge for you:

#### Step 5: Drawing Robust Conclusions

Now that we understand the blank entry, let‚Äôs revisit the actual
results.

Bordeaux is the most visited city, followed by Pau and Paris.

> **But‚Ä¶ üö® is that really true?**

Look closely and you‚Äôll notice that Paris appears in different forms,
like ‚ÄúParis‚Äù and ‚ÄúParis (Champs-√âlys√©es)‚Äù. These inconsistencies can
split your counts.

Let‚Äôs identify and count all possible occurrences of Bordeaux, Pau, and
Paris. How? Do you remember `stringr::str_detect()` we discovered in
[the previous
post](https://datasharpacademy.com/tour-de-france-meets-data-science-a-beginners-case-study/)?

    sum(stringr::str_detect(city_names, "Bordeaux"), na.rm=TRUE)

    ## [1] 130

    sum(stringr::str_detect(city_names, "Pau"), na.rm=TRUE)

    ## [1] 132

Looks like Bordeaux is consistent. In contrast, Pau shows up a few extra
times. But are these extra occurrences real?

    table(city_names[stringr::str_detect(city_names, "Pau")])

    ## 
    ##                       Pau                  Pauillac Saint-Paul-Trois-Ch√¢teaux 
    ##                       127                         1                         4

Nope, they were **false positives**! Bordeaux has been visited more than
Pau. But how many times was Paris visited? With the data above, we
already see that Paris was visited many more times than Bordeaux. Let‚Äôs
count how many more there are.

    table(city_names[stringr::str_detect(city_names, "Paris")])

    ## 
    ##         Disneyland Paris   Le Touquet-Paris-Plage                    Paris 
    ##                        3                        4                      104 
    ##   Paris (Champs-√âlys√©es) Paris (Eiffel Tower)[12]   Paris La D√©fense Arena 
    ##                       48                        1                        1

    sum(stringr::str_detect(city_names, "Paris"), na.rm=TRUE)

    ## [1] 161

All names but `Le Touquet-Paris-Plage` correspond to Paris.

> üá´üá∑üóº When combined, **Paris was visited 157 times**, making it the
> most visited city in Tour de France history (as many of you probably
> expected!).

### 3.2 What Are the Smallest and Largest Time Gaps Between the Winner and the Runner-Up of the Tour?

This question takes us into the `Time` column of the `finishers` table.
The challenge? The data are far from being clean or consistent:

-   For the winner, the column contains their total time..
-   For all other finishers, the column shows the time difference with
    the winner. This type of data is typically referred to as an
    ‚Äúanomaly‚Äù or a deviation from a reference value.

#### Step 1: Filtering the Data

We are only interested in the time difference between the riders ranked
second and the winners. Therefore, we can create this subset of the
finishers table:

    finishers_only2nd <- finishers[finishers$Rank == 2, ]
    head(finishers_only2nd, n=15)

    ##     Year Rank                          Rider         Time           Team
    ## 2   1903    2           Lucien Pothier (FRA) + 2h 59' 21"   La Fran√ßaise
    ## 23  1904    2 Jean-Baptiste Dortignacq (FRA) + 2h 16' 14"               
    ## 38  1905    2    Hippolyte Aucouturier (FRA)              Peugeot-Wolber
    ## 62  1906    2        Georges Passerieu (FRA)                     Peugeot
    ## 76  1907    2         Gustave Garrigou (FRA)              Peugeot-Wolber
    ## 109 1908    2           Francois Faber (LUX)              Peugeot‚ÄìWolber
    ## 145 1909    2         Gustave Garrigou (FRA)                      Alcyon
    ## 200 1910    2           Francois Faber (LUX)                      Alcyon
    ## 241 1911    2               Paul Duboc (FRA)                La Fran√ßaise
    ## 269 1912    2        Eugene Christophe (FRA)                       Armor
    ## 310 1913    2         Gustave Garrigou (FRA)      +8' 37"        Peugeot
    ## 335 1914    2          Henri Pelissier (FRA)     + 1' 50" Peugeot‚ÄìWolber
    ## 389 1919    2            Jean Alavoine (FRA) + 1h 42' 54"               
    ## 399 1920    2          Hector Heusghem (BEL)    + 57' 21"               
    ## 421 1921    2          Hector Heusghem (BEL)    + 18' 36"

We can already see that the information is missing for the years 1905 to
1912. Therefore, we will need to eliminate these years before
proceeding.

> **üö¥ Tour trivia** Between 1905 and 1912, the Tour riders were ranked

Let‚Äôs identify what kind of ‚Äúempty‚Äù we‚Äôre dealing with. Do we have empty
strings, i.e.¬†`""`, or `NA`/`NULL` values?

    finishers_only2nd[finishers_only2nd$Year == 1905, 'Time']

    ## [1] ""

It appears that these are empty strings (`""`), not NA or NULL. Let‚Äôs
remove them:

    nrow(finishers_only2nd)

    ## [1] 109

    finishers_only2nd <- finishers_only2nd[ ! finishers_only2nd$Time == "", ]
    nrow(finishers_only2nd)

    ## [1] 101

We‚Äôre now working with 101 editions of the Tour when time defined the
final ranking.

#### Step 2: Cleaning the Time Data

This is the critical, challenging step.

The `Time` anomalies are stored as complex strings that we need to
convert to numbers. Unfortunately, this way of reporting time is
non-standard. No built-in R function can handle these directly ‚Ä¶ so
we‚Äôll write our own!

Here‚Äôs a custom function to turn these strings into total seconds,
making comparisons and ranking between them straightforward. I will
guide you through every step of the function below, but I would like you
to take some time to read and try to understand it first. I only used
functions we previously encountered.

    convert_time_string <- function(time_string) {
        ## There are again some non-ASCII characters, so I am removing them
        clean_str <- stringi::stri_trans_general(time_string, "latin-ascii")

        ## Remove '+' prefix
        clean_str <- substr(clean_str, 2, nchar(time_string))

        ## Removing all spaces from the string
        clean_str <- stringr::str_replace_all(clean_str, " ", "")

        # Setting everything to 0
        hours <- minutes <- seconds <- 0

        # Extracting hours
        if(stringr::str_detect(clean_str, 'h')) {
            cut_str <- stringr::str_split(clean_str, 'h', simplify=TRUE)
            hours <- as.numeric(cut_str[1,1])
            clean_str <- cut_str[1,2]
        }

        # Extracting minutes
        if(stringr::str_detect(clean_str, "'")) {
            cut_str <- stringr::str_split(clean_str, "'", simplify=TRUE)
            minutes <- as.numeric(cut_str[1,1])
            clean_str <- cut_str[1,2]
        }

        # Extracting seconds
        if(stringr::str_detect(clean_str, '\"')) {
            cut_str <- stringr::str_split(clean_str, '\"', simplify=TRUE)
            seconds <- as.numeric(cut_str[1,1])
            clean_str <- cut_str[1,2]
        }

        # Total time in seconds
        total_seconds <- hours * 3600 + minutes * 60 + seconds
        return(total_seconds)
    }

**‚öôÔ∏è‚öôÔ∏è How does this function work?**

Let‚Äôs take a closer look at what this function does and why each step is
needed. This will help you learn how to approach similar problems on
your own.

We want to transform a time string like this: `+ 5h 49' 12"` into a
clean number (5*3600+49*60+12 = 20952) representing the total number of
seconds (which we can then compare, sort, etc.).

1.  **time\_string is our input**: This is one value from the Time
    column of our dataset. It can look like `+ 1h 2' 14"` or just
    `+ 42"` depending on the race. Not all time strings have entries for
    the hours, minutes, or seconds.
2.  **We clean up the string with stri\_trans\_general()**: This dataset
    is full of non-ASCII characters, and this column is no exception. My
    first attempts crashed because of the mixed presence of curly and
    straight quotes. While we could have fixed that before using the
    function, including it in the function body adds an extra security
    if we ever want to reuse this function in another context.
3.  **We remove the ‚Äú+‚Äù sign with substr()**: All our time strings begin
    with a +, but we don‚Äôt need it. Using substr(), we grab everything
    after the first character. I used `substr()` here as an opportunity
    to demonstrate a new tool, although
    `str_replace(clean_str, "+", "")` would also work.
4.  **We remove all the spaces**: To make the parsing easier, we remove
    all whitespaces, replacing them with an empty character. Note:
    `str_replace()` only removes the first space. Since we want to
    remove all of them, we use `str_replace_all()`.
5.  **We initialise all time components to zero**: Not all time strings
    include hours or minutes, so we define `hours`, `minutes`, and
    `seconds` equal to 0. Step 8 requires hours, minutes, and seconds to
    have values. Setting them to 0 will not affect the results if our
    time string does not contain an entry for these parameters.
6.  **We extract hours if they exist**: We check if the string contains
    an ‚Äúh‚Äù. If yes, we split it. ‚Äú5h49‚Äô12"‚Äù ‚Üí \[‚Äú5‚Äù, ‚Äú49‚Äô12"‚Äù\] We save
    the ‚Äú5‚Äù as the number of hours and update `clean_str` with the
    second element to work on the remaining part.
7.  **We extract minutes and seconds**: We apply the same idea,
    searching for ‚Äú‚Äô‚Äù and ‚Äú"‚Äù to split the string for the minutes and
    then seconds.
8.  **We convert everything to seconds**: I bring everything together by
    converting the hours and minutes to seconds, and summing everything.
9.  **We return that total**: The `total_second` we compute gets
    returned by the function. That‚Äôs the value we‚Äôll use in our
    analysis.

Now that our function works, we want to apply it to every value in the
`Time` column.

In R, one great way to do this is with `sapply()`:

This applies `convert_time_string()` to every row of the column and
returns a vector of results.

    total_seconds=sapply(finishers_only2nd[, 'Time'], convert_time_string)
    head(total_seconds)

    ## + 2h 59' 21" + 2h 16' 14"      +8' 37"     + 1' 50" + 1h 42' 54"    + 57' 21" 
    ##        10761         8174          517          110         6174         3441

You can manually check that the number of seconds corresponds to the
above Time string.

We can then append these results to our data table using `cbind()` (for
column binding):

    finishers_only2nd <- cbind(
                    finishers_only2nd,
                    "total_seconds"=total_seconds
                )
    head(finishers_only2nd)

    ##     Year Rank                          Rider         Time           Team
    ## 2   1903    2           Lucien Pothier (FRA) + 2h 59' 21"   La Fran√ßaise
    ## 23  1904    2 Jean-Baptiste Dortignacq (FRA) + 2h 16' 14"               
    ## 310 1913    2         Gustave Garrigou (FRA)      +8' 37"        Peugeot
    ## 335 1914    2          Henri Pelissier (FRA)     + 1' 50" Peugeot‚ÄìWolber
    ## 389 1919    2            Jean Alavoine (FRA) + 1h 42' 54"               
    ## 399 1920    2          Hector Heusghem (BEL)    + 57' 21"               
    ##     total_seconds
    ## 2           10761
    ## 23           8174
    ## 310           517
    ## 335           110
    ## 389          6174
    ## 399          3441

Now our table has a new column `total_seconds` ready for sorting,
filtering, or whatever else we want to do.

#### Step 3: Answering the question

> What are the smallest and largest time gaps between a Tour de France
> winner and the second-place rider?

Let‚Äôs compute the minimum and maximum values in our new total\_seconds
column:

    print(paste("Minimal time between first and second riders:", min(finishers_only2nd$total_seconds), "seconds."))

    ## [1] "Minimal time between first and second riders: 8 seconds."

    print(paste("Maximal time between first and second riders:", max(finishers_only2nd$total_seconds), "seconds (or", round(max(finishers_only2nd$total_seconds)/3600,2),"hours)."))

    ## [1] "Maximal time between first and second riders: 10761 seconds (or 2.99 hours)."

**üìè The verdict?**

-   The smallest gap was just **8 seconds**.
-   The largest gap was almost 3 hours! üòÆ

I‚Äôm having trouble deciding which result is the most surprising.

But that 8-second margin sounds intense. Can we find out when that
happened?

Can we identify which Tour de France that was?

This gives us the perfect excuse to introduce a handy function:
`which.min()`.

-   `min(x)` gives you the smallest value in a vector.
-   `which.min(x)` gives you the position (or row index) of that
    smallest value in that vector.

And once you have the position, you can use it to extract the
corresponding row from `finishers_only2nd`:

    finishers_only2nd[which.min(finishers_only2nd$total_seconds), ]

    ##      Year Rank                Rider     Time                 Team total_seconds

### 3.3 Who has finished last the most?

With this final question, let‚Äôs honour those away from the spotlight.

Cycling is a team sport: champions rely on their teammates to control
the race, fetch bottles, and shield them from the wind. For many years,
the last rider in the final ranking of the Tour de France, the so-called
*lanterne rouge*, was even invited onto the final podium.

So let‚Äôs do the same here by paying homage to the loyal champion of
champions. üôá

#### Step 1: Understanding the Challenge

Identifying the winner of each Tour de France is easy: we can use
`Rank == 1`.

But for the last rider, it‚Äôs trickier:

-   The number of finishers varies each year.
-   In 1903, the last rider was ranked 21st, while in 2022, the last
    rider was ranked 134th.

We need a flexible way to find the last rider for each edition.

#### Step 2: Using tapply() to Extract Last Riders

**How to identify the list rider from each Tour de France edition?**

The *lanterne rouge* is defined as the rider with the largest rank **for
each edition**.

When you hear **for each edition** or similar criteria, you should think
of group filtering.

We need a function that performs a *specific task* for *each element of
the group*.

The easiest way to apply a function to different subgroups within a
dataset is with `tapply()`.

It takes:

-   A vector of values to analyse (here, the names of finishers),
-   A categorical vector to group by (here, the Year of the Tour),
-   A function to apply to each subgroup (here, we can use `tail()` to
    get the last element since the riders are sorted from first to
    last),
-   Additional arguments if needed (`n = 1` to get a single last name).

Since our data are ordered from first to last rider, `tail(..., n=1)`
will return the last rider for each year, giving us exactly what we
need.

    last_each_tour <- tapply(finishers$Rider, finishers$Year, tail, n=1)
    head(last_each_tour)

    ##                        1903                        1904 
    ##   "Arsene Millocheau (FRA)" "Antoine Deflotriere (FRA)" 
    ##                        1905                        1906 
    ##      "Clovis Lacroix (FRA)"   "Georges Bronchard (FRA)" 
    ##                        1907                        1908 
    ##     "Albert Chartier (FRA)"      "Henri Anthoine (FRA)"

    ## Let's make this table look sharper
    last_each_tour <- data.frame("Year" = names(last_each_tour), "Name" = last_each_tour)
    head(last_each_tour)

    ##      Year                      Name
    ## 1903 1903   Arsene Millocheau (FRA)
    ## 1904 1904 Antoine Deflotriere (FRA)
    ## 1905 1905      Clovis Lacroix (FRA)
    ## 1906 1906   Georges Bronchard (FRA)
    ## 1907 1907     Albert Chartier (FRA)
    ## 1908 1908      Henri Anthoine (FRA)

#### Step 3: Counting Who Came Last Most Often

Now, we count how often each name appears in our `last_each_tour` table
to find the rider who finished last the most times in Tour de France
history.

    sort(table(last_each_tour$Name), decreasing=TRUE)[1]

    ## Wim Vansevenant (BEL) 
    ##                     3

## 4. Food for thought

1.  **Real-world data is rarely clean or consistent.** From empty
    strings and strange characters to formatting quirks and typos,
    working with messy data is the norm, not the exception.
2.  **When data looks strange, stop and investigate.** A city with no
    name? A time gap that looks suspicious? Dig deeper. It may be an
    issue with the data, but there could also be a logical explanation.
    But you must be curious enough to look.
3.  **Use built-in tools to simplify your life.** Functions like
    `tapply()`, `which.min()`, or even `str_detect()` are powerful
    allies. I will showcase as many of these useful tricks in my posts,
    so stay alert for more (Even when the chosen topic may not appeal to
    you!).
4.  **And when what you need doesn‚Äôt exist, build it.** Sometimes, no
    function will do exactly what you want. That‚Äôs when writing your own
    becomes not just helpful, but empowering. It lets you tailor your
    analysis to your data, not the other way around.
