## 1. Start Here: Building Data Confidence

Data analysis can feel intimidating, especially when you‚Äôre working with
real-world datasets that are messy, inconsistent, and rarely behave like
the polished examples you find in tutorials. But this is where the real
learning **and the real fun** begins.

In this post, we‚Äôll practice extracting information from data using
simple, robust R commands. I kept things simple and practical, focusing
on thinking critically with the data.

Each part builds on the previous one, helping you develop structured,
confident workflows.

**Who is this post for?** This post is for beginners who want to learn
practical data manipulation and sharpen their instincts for extracting
information from complex datasets. It will also challenge those who
already know R but haven‚Äôt yet practiced systematic data interrogation.

**Topics covered in this post:**

-   Loading datasets with non-standard characters.
-   Extracting information from single columns.
-   Conditional subsetting of vectors and data frames.
-   Mindful result evaluation.

## 2. Meet the Data: The *Tour de France* Dataset

Before diving into any data analysis, it‚Äôs essential to take the time to
**look at the data with your own eyes**. This step is often skipped, but
it‚Äôs where many problems‚Äîand insights‚Äîfirst reveal themselves. **Make
sure you see the data for how they are and not how you think they are.**

Ask yourself:

-   What do these data represent?
-   What is measured, and how?
-   What are the units and scales?
-   Are there quirks in formatting or naming?

In this post, we‚Äôll use historical data from the *Tour de France* to
practice this mindset. The dataset includes information on stages,
winners, distances, and participation across more than a century of
races. Each Tour de France is composed of several stages, each stage
having a uniquer winner. The cumulated time across all stages define the
overall winner of the Tour de France. This dataset a rich, real-world
example. Although it looks quite simple (see tables below), it is full
of typos and inconsistencies, making it ideal for sharpening your data
intuition.

All data used here come from this [Kaggle
datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/keremkarayaz/tour-de-france).
I encourage you to download the data and to run the commands yourself.
But I want you to think about what you are doing; do not just run code.

We will work with three tables:

<br> <br>

Before we move on, take a moment to **skim these tables slowly**. Notice
the variety of data types: numbers mixed with units, dates with
different formats, rider names with embedded country codes. These are
the kinds of details that will shape how we clean, transform, and
analyse these data later.

Look for potential challenges and opportunities:

-   Which columns might need cleaning before analysis?
-   Which columns are categorical vs.¬†numerical?
-   Are there inconsistencies that might require your attention?

> üíõ **Key takeaway:** Before writing a single line of code, ALWAYS
> spend time **looking at your dataset and understanding it**. Identify
> how your different tables are linked to each other. This will help you
> anticipate challenges and guide your analysis.

## 3. Let‚Äôs Get to Work

Now that you‚Äôre familiar with the dataset, let‚Äôs start **interrogating
the data**. We will begin by practicing simple R commands to extract
meaningful information, exploring how to count unique values, subset
conditionally, and evaluate results mindfully. This will build a solid
foundation before we move on to string manipulation and data
visualisation in the next posts.

### 3.1 Installing / Loading Your Packages

R‚Äôs default base package contains a lot of functionalities. However, it
is more than likely that you will have to add new functionalities by
loading what is called ‚Äúpackages‚Äù. This analysis is no different.
Installing packages in R is straightforward:

    if(!require('readr')) install.packages('readr')
    if(!require('rio')) install.packages('rio')
    if(!require('stringr')) install.packages('stringr')

Loading packages is commonly done with the `library(package_name)`
function. However, it only works if the package is already installed on
your machine. The code above is a bit longer, but it tries to load the
package with `require()` and if the package is not found, it will first
install it.

## 4. Where We All Begin: Loading The Data

There are many ways to load data into your R environment. Since our
files are plain CSVs, we‚Äôll start simply:

    finishers <- read.csv('./data/tdf_finishers.csv')
    head(finishers)

    ##   Year Rank                    Rider         Time         Team
    ## 1 1903    1      Maurice Garin¬†(FRA)  94h 33' 14" La Fran√ßaise
    ## 2 1903    2     Lucien Pothier¬†(FRA) + 2h 59' 21" La Fran√ßaise
    ## 3 1903    3   Fernand Augereau¬†(FRA) + 4h 29' 24" La Fran√ßaise
    ## 4 1903    4 Rodolfo Muller[27]¬†(ITA) + 4h 39' 30" La Fran√ßaise
    ## 5 1903    5       Jean Fischer¬†(FRA) + 4h 58' 44" La Fran√ßaise
    ## 6 1903    6       Marcel Kerff¬†(BEL) + 5h 52' 24"

I use the `head()` function to display the first six rows of the
dataset. Everything is looking good.

    stages <- read.csv('./data/tdf_stages.csv')
    head(stages)

    ##   Year       Date Stage                Course        Distance
    ## 1 1903 1903-07-01     1         Paris to Lyon 467¬†km (290¬†mi)
    ## 2 1903 1903-07-05     2     Lyon to Marseille 374¬†km (232¬†mi)
    ## 3 1903 1903-07-08     3 Marseille to Toulouse 423¬†km (263¬†mi)
    ## 4 1903 1903-07-12     4  Toulouse to Bordeaux 268¬†km (167¬†mi)
    ## 5 1903 1903-07-13     5    Bordeaux to Nantes 425¬†km (264¬†mi)
    ## 6 1903 1903-07-18     6       Nantes to Paris 471¬†km (293¬†mi)
    ##                     Type                      Winner
    ## 1            Plain stage         Maurice Garin¬†(FRA)
    ## 2 Stage with mountain(s) Hippolyte Aucouturier¬†(FRA)
    ## 3            Plain stage Hippolyte Aucouturier¬†(FRA)
    ## 4            Plain stage        Charles Laeser¬†(SUI)
    ## 5            Plain stage         Maurice Garin¬†(FRA)
    ## 6            Plain stage         Maurice Garin¬†(FRA)

Also fine. Now let‚Äôs try the last file:

    stages <- read.csv('./data/tdf_tours.csv')

    ## Error in type.convert.default(data[[i]], as.is = as.is[i], dec = dec,  :
    ##  invalid multibyte string at '<96>19 <4a>uly 1903'

Oops. Welcome to real-world data, where the first ‚Äúeasy step‚Äù breaks
immediately.

**What does this error mean?** Usually, it indicates there‚Äôs a strange
character in your file that your computer can‚Äôt read properly. By
default, computers only ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù standard keyboard characters, and
unusual characters can cause issues during import.

> üí° **Tip:** R error messages are often cryptic, and it‚Äôs normal to
> feel stuck when reading them for the first time(s). Don‚Äôt forget you
> can always Google the exact error message or ask your favorite AI tool
> for help. Data analysis is not about knowing everything; it is about
> knowing how to solve problems.

When I opened the file in Excel, I found odd values like *‚Äú1√±19 July
1903‚Äù* in the Dates column. This unexpected *√±* character likely wasn‚Äôt
intentional and may result from moving files between operating systems
(Windows, Mac, Linux) or even different versions of the same OS.

How to move forward? We need to read the file using function with a
character encoding able to understand what this *√±* character is. There
are many encoding system and the first one you should try is UTF-8.

    tours <- readr::read_csv('./data/tdf_tours.csv', locale=readr::locale(encoding="UTF-8"))

    ## Rows: 109 Columns: 6
    ## ‚îÄ‚îÄ Column specification ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ

You‚Äôll notice I used the `read_csv()` function of the `readr` package
instead of the base R‚Äôs `read.csv()`. Why not use this function always?
You could! It is a matter of preference. Trying `read.csv()` first is
usually a bit faster. Another difference is that the result of
`read.csv()` is a data frame, while the result of `readr::read_csv()` is
a tibble. Both behave similarly and differences are too marginal to
impact our goals here. Take-home: try `read.csv()` first and if you get
an encoding error, try `readr::read_csv()`.

Another handy alternative is using the `import()` function from the
`rio` package, which can load nearly any file type (text, binary, with
or without encoding quirks) and return a clean dataset. How it does it?
I have no idea! It‚Äôs like a tiny bit of magic for your workflow.
However, since `rio` is less used, if you plan to share your code, it‚Äôs
often safer to use `read.csv()` or `read_csv()`. But it is a good trick
to know. Here it is:

    tours <- rio::import('./data/tdf_tours.csv')
    head(tours)

    ##   Year                      Dates Stages                  Distance Starters
    ## 1 1903          1\x9619 July 1903      6 2,428\xa0km (1,509\xa0mi)       60
    ## 2 1904          2\x9624 July 1904      6 2,428\xa0km (1,509\xa0mi)       88
    ## 3 1905          9\x9630 July 1905     11 2,994\xa0km (1,860\xa0mi)       60
    ## 4 1906          4\x9629 July 1906     13 4,637\xa0km (2,881\xa0mi)       82
    ## 5 1907  8 July \x96 4 August 1907     14 4,488\xa0km (2,789\xa0mi)       93
    ## 6 1908 13 July \x96 9 August 1908     14 4,497\xa0km (2,794\xa0mi)      112
    ##   Finishers
    ## 1        21
    ## 2        15
    ## 3        24
    ## 4        14
    ## 5        33
    ## 6        36

Both methods will give you the same data, with differences in appearance
due to how tibbles (`readr`) and data frames (`rio`) are displayed in
your console.

<br> <br>

Wow, that was already a journey, wasn‚Äôt it? Loading datasets is often
treated as trivial, so most tutorials use clean, pre-processed data.
It‚Äôs only when you‚Äôre working with your own real-world data that you
discover the dark side of the moon.

But we made it back stronger, and now we can move on to the fun part:
analysing the data.

## 5. What Can We Learn From These Data?

### 5.1 How Many Stage Winners in History?

This simple question requires us to look closely at the `stages` table,
specifically at the `Winner` column. However, we immediately notice that
this information isn‚Äôt unique, as many riders have won multiple stages
throughout their careers.

To find out how many distinct riders have won at least one stage, we
extract the `Winner` column using the `$` symbol and apply the
`unique()` function. This function takes a vector as input (*i.e.*, the
column from the data frame) and returns a new vector containing only the
unique names, removing duplicates. Once we have this vector, here called
`stage_winners`, we can use `length()` to count the number of unique
stage winners.

    stage_winners <- unique(stages$Winner)
    length(stage_winners)

    ## [1] 917

> üöµ **917 distinct riders have won at least one Tour de France stage.**

> estimation.

### 5.2 How Many Unique Tour de France Winners in History?

At first glance, this question looks similar to the previous one, right?
Yet our code will differ due to the structure of the data.

If the `tours` table had a `Winner` column, we could have used the same
approach as in Q1. However, the `tours` table does not provide winner
names. Instead, the complete rankings for each Tour de France are in the
`finishers` table.

In the `finishers` table, a Tour de France winner is defined as a
`Rider` whose `Rank` is 1. This means we need to combine information
from two columns to get our answer: we need to identify the riders with
`Rank` equal to 1, extract their names, and then count the number of
unique names, just as we did in Q1.

There are several ways to subset a data frame in R. One common approach
is to select rows based on their row numbers using a vector of indexes,
like this:

    finishers[c(1, 2, 4, 7), ]

    ##   Year Rank                    Rider         Time         Team
    ## 1 1903    1      Maurice Garin¬†(FRA)  94h 33' 14" La Fran√ßaise
    ## 2 1903    2     Lucien Pothier¬†(FRA) + 2h 59' 21" La Fran√ßaise
    ## 4 1903    4 Rodolfo Muller[27]¬†(ITA) + 4h 39' 30" La Fran√ßaise
    ## 7 1903    7     Julien Lootens¬†(BEL) + 8h 31' 08"    Brennabor

But this requires knowing the row indexes, which we don‚Äôt in this case.
We could do it by hand, but the `finishers` table has 9895 rows, which
would take us ages AND would be prone to errors. For this analysis, it‚Äôs
more advantageous to use a logical condition to extract the rows we
need.

We need to identify all the rows where Rank is equal to 1. It can be
done as follow:

    rows_winners <- finishers$Rank == 1
    head(rows_winners)

    ## [1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE

where the `==` operator compares each value in the `Rank` column to `1`
and returns `TRUE` when the value is `1`, and `FALSE` otherwise. This
creates a logical (boolean) vector that we can inject into our data
frame to filter rows, allowing us to select only the columns of interest
for those matching conditions.

    tour_winners <- finishers[rows_winners, "Rider"]
    tour_winners

Now we have a vector of Tour de France winners, but it still contains
duplicates since some riders have won multiple times. To find the number
of unique Tour de France winners, we can apply the same solution we used
in Q1: use the `unique()` function to remove duplicates, and then use
`length()` to count how many unique riders have won the Tour de France.

    length(unique(tour_winners))

    ## [1] 66

> üöµ 66 different riders appear to have won at least one Tour de France.

> üö® **But is that really the case?**

A lot can go wrong when processing data, from coding mistakes (*Did I
actually do the right thing?*) to issues in the input data itself. I
cannot emphasise enough how important it is to **double-check your
results**.

Let‚Äôs go back to our last question. We identified 66 different names,
but do these names actually represent 66 *different riders*?

Names in datasets are prone to errors: typos, inconsistent accents, or
differences in formatting (like ‚ÄúBernard Hinault‚Äù vs.¬†‚ÄúHinault,
Bernard‚Äù) can cause the same rider to be counted multiple times.

To check, let‚Äôs look at the **last 10 names** in our list. We can do
this easily by using the `tail()` function, which is similar to the
`head()` we used at the beginning:

    last_10_winner_names <- tail(tour_winners, n=10)
    last_10_winner_names

    ##  [1] "Chris Froome¬†(UK)"      "Vincenzo Nibali¬†(ITA)"  "Chris Froome¬†(GBR)"    
    ##  [4] "Chris Froome¬†(GBR)"     "Chris Froome¬†(GBR)"     "Geraint Thomas¬†(GBR)"  
    ##  [7] "Egan Bernal¬†(COL)"      "Tadej Pogaƒçar¬†(SLO)"    "Tadej Pogaƒçar¬†(SLO)"   
    ## [10] "Jonas Vingegaard¬†(DEN)"

If we look closely, we can identify a name that appears twice with
different spelling: `Chris Froome (UK)` and `Chris Froome (GBR)`. Given
the difference between these two names, it is fair to assume they refer
to the *same person*, but with the country recorded differently (‚ÄúUnited
Kingdom‚Äù vs.¬†‚ÄúGreat Britain‚Äù).

> üöµ Assuming these two Chris Froome entries refer to the same person,
> **there are therefore 65 distinct Tour de France winners.**

This is still the case as the Tour 2025 just started ‚Äì but will it still
be the case in a couple of weeks?

### 5.3 How Many Riders Won the Tour de France Without Ever Winning a Stage?

Now, this question is more interesting because it requires us to
*combine information from two tables*: the `finishers` table (to
identify Tour winners) and the `stages` table (to check if those winners
ever won a stage).

In the previous questions, we calculated two vectors:

-   `stage_winners`
-   `tour_winners`

Now we need to **compare them** to identify which riders in
`tour_winners` are **not** in `stage_winners`. As with most data
analysis tasks, there are many routes you could take to answer this
question.

One straightforward option is to use a `for` loop. Here‚Äôs what the
following code snippet does:

1.  For every `rider` name in our `tour_winners` list,
2.  Check whether that rider‚Äôs name is `%in%` the `stage_winners` list,
3.  Combine this boolean test with the `!` symbol (which inverts
    `TRUE`/`FALSE`) to check whether the rider is *not* in the
    `stage_winners` list,
4.  If the rider is *not* in `stage_winners`, we `print` the rider‚Äôs
    name.

<!-- -->

    for(rider in tour_winners) {
        if(! rider %in% stage_winners) {
            print(rider)
        }
    }

    ## [1] "Henri Cornet¬†(FRA)"
    ## [1] "Maurice De Waele¬†(BEL)"
    ## [1] "Roger Walkowiak¬†(FRA)"
    ## [1] "Chris Froome¬†(UK)"
    ## [1] "Egan Bernal¬†(COL)"

We can see five names.

Before exploring whether all these names are *truly* valid solutions to
Q3, let me show you another, more compact solution that avoids using an
explicit `for` loop. The `setdiff()` function takes two vectors and
checks whether elements in the first vector are *not* found in the
second vector.

    GC_but_no_stages <- setdiff(tour_winners, stage_winners)
    GC_but_no_stages

    ## [1] "Henri Cornet¬†(FRA)"     "Maurice De Waele¬†(BEL)" "Roger Walkowiak¬†(FRA)" 
    ## [4] "Chris Froome¬†(UK)"      "Egan Bernal¬†(COL)"

Unsurprisingly, we get the same five names as before.

But are these names *actually* correct?

We already know that `Chris Froome (UK)` is a problematic name. The
absence of `Chris Froome (GBR)` in this list indicates that Chris Froome
won stages, so we can confidently exclude `Chris Froome (UK)` from our
suspect list, reducing it to **four names**.

There are two common types of typos we can easily explore at this stage:

1.  **Upper and lower case inconsistencies** (e.g., ‚Äúde‚Äù, ‚ÄúDe‚Äù, ‚ÄúDE‚Äù),
2.  **The use (or absence) of accents** or similar ‚Äúdecorations‚Äù on
    letters.

One name that immediately raises suspicion is **‚ÄúMaurice De Waele
(BEL)‚Äù**. Family names with particles (e.g., ‚Äúde‚Äù, ‚Äúvan‚Äù, ‚Äúvon‚Äù) are
often spelled inconsistently across datasets.

A useful tool for checking potential case issues is the `tolower()`
function (or its counterpart, `toupper()`), which standardises strings
to lower (or upper) case before comparison. Additionally, instead of
scanning the *entire* name, we can focus on a distinctive fragment using
`str_detect()` from the `stringr` package.

> üí° Tip: When comparing names across datasets, normalising the text

> inconsistencies.

Here‚Äôs how we can check if Maurice De Waele won stages under a different
case or spelling. We look if any name in our list of stage winners
contains the characters ‚Äúwaele‚Äù (lower case!).

    stage_winners[stringr::str_detect(tolower(stage_winners), tolower('Waele'))]

    ## [1] "Maurice Dewaele¬†(BEL)"

This returns a name that is very close to our suspect, and we can fairly
assume these two names refer to the *same person*.

We can repeat this operation to check for potential inconsistencies with
**Roger Walkowiak**, using either his first name or last name as search
terms:

    stage_winners[stringr::str_detect(tolower(stage_winners), tolower('Walk'))]

    ## character(0)

    stage_winners[stringr::str_detect(tolower(stage_winners), tolower('roger'))]

    ## [1] "Roger Lap√©bie¬†(FRA)"      "Roger Lambrecht¬†(BEL)"   
    ## [3] "Roger L√©v√™que¬†(FRA)"      "Roger Hassenforder¬†(FRA)"
    ## [5] "Roger Rivi√®re¬†(FRA)"      "Roger de Breuker¬†(BEL)"  
    ## [7] "Roger Pingeon¬†(FRA)"      "Roger De Vlaeminck¬†(BEL)"
    ## [9] "Michael Rogers¬†(AUS)"

There are no riders with similar names that seem to have won stages. The
same procedure can be repeated for the remaining two names. But neither
Egan Bernal or Henri Cornet have ever won any Tour de France stages
either.

## 6. Concluding Remarks

With this simple Tour de France dataset, we were able to practice the
first principles of data analysis. When I decided to analyse this
dataset, I was certain everything would go smoothly and I could focus
more on showcasing more functions like `setdiff()`. However, despite the
simplicity of the questions asked, this exercise has highlighted several
very common issues (*e.g.* issues importing data, typos in names,
duplicated entries). This post ended up highlighting how to navigate
noisy data ‚Äì This was not my initial goal but it was a better
presentation of what data analysis truly is.

Using the Tour de France dataset, we‚Äôve practised applying **first
principles of data analysis** to real-world data. When I started this
post, I expected everything to go smoothly so I could focus on
showcasing more functions like `setdiff()`. Instead, even these simple
questions revealed common challenges, such as issues with imports, typos
in names, and duplicated entries.

Unexpectedly, this post became a practical lesson in **navigating noisy
data**, which is a more accurate depiction of what real data analysis
truly is.

### 6.1 Take-Home Messages

1.  **Always look at your data; do not take results at face value.**
    Small inconsistencies can lead to large errors if left unchecked.
2.  **Decompose your problems in smaller ones.** Identifying key
    milestones will help you reach your objective more consistently. Big
    objectives are hard to reach; small objectives are much easier.
3.  **Be clever in how you calculate things.** Sometimes it is easier to
    calculate the *opposite* of what you want. Here, counting how many
    riders won a stage while winning the Tour was a simpler, clearer
    path than directly counting non-winners.
4.  **There are many routes to reach your analytical goals.** Choose the
    one that feels most comfortable and understandable to you,
    especially while learning.

> arrived at them, and *being mindful of the hidden details* in your
